### Hummelflug in a Nutshell

At first you want to set up your swarm:
        
        php hummelflug create 

Before you can attack your target you need to wake up your swarm:

        php hummelflug up
        
Now you can attack your target:

        php hummelflug attack <URL>
        
Tired of attacking peaceful servers?

        php hummelflug down
        

The caveat! (PLEASE READ)
-------------------------

If you decide to use Hummelflug, please keep in mind
the following important caveat: they are, more-or-less
a distributed denial-of-service attack in a fancy
package and, therefore, if you point them at any server
you donâ€™t own you will behaving unethically, have your
Amazon Web Services account locked-out, and be liable
in a court of law for any downtime you cause.

You have been warned.
